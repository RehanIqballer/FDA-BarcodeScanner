# FDA-BarcodeScanner
Able to scan all FDA products and show their ingredients up to roughly January 2023. 

You can try it here: https://www.aycefooding.com/BarcodeScanner.php
Test with multiple products, you may have to scan same item multiple times.
On prompt you will just see camera view, hold barcode upto it and make sure the barcode takes up majority of the screen and can be seen clearly.

Can be used on both PC and Mobile, on mobile you will have to exit camera once screen turns back in order to see if your barcode was registered. The little button will not work a second time :( you will have to refresh the page. 

If you need the ingredient data and what not, you can find it here: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html The one used in this project is the 2019_04 branded food csv I believe.
